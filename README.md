The Protagonist is the player character in Colosseum: Road to Freedom and largely concerns The Protagonist's adventures as a gladiator working under Magerius to earn both honor and enough money to pay of his slave debt to earn freedom by entering on multiple arenas.
 
The Protagonist's gender is automatically set as male and the Protagonist's appearance depends on his origins while being questioned by Magerius at the start of the game, there are 3 models in the original game, **Type A**, **Type B** and **Type C**. **Type A** is lightly tanned man with black hair. **Type B** is a fair skinned blonde haired man. **Type C** is a dark skinned man with scalp short crew cut hair. In the arena, the player can prepare the Protagonist with the proper equipment and move sets and choose from the available matches to enter. During the match, the player will attack with armed weapons or with their bare hands at other gladiator opponents. The Protagonist can knock off other gladiator's weapons and armors and pick them up to use it in their favor. After winning a match, the Protagonist will earn money and AP and return to hub area to prepare for the next day or move on with the story.
 
When the game begins, the Protagonist is owned by a slave trader named Largus on the outskirts of the Roman Empire. This is an Arena where slaves continuously battle to the death to attract the attention of buyers. a slave named Memnon suggests that they attempt to attract the attention of specifically a Roman trader or they won't survive the arena, however eventually the Protagonist is pitted against Memnon and forced to kill him. This match attracts the attention of a Roman named Magerius, who purchases the Protagonist and then transports him to the city of Rome.
 
As the Protagonist trains under Magerius to attempt to gain their freedom, he is eventually approached by a woman named Marcia and a man named Laetus who gains interest in the players rise. This attention from Marcia also draws the ire of a gladiator named Narcissus whom the Protagonist has to face in combat on two occasions.
 
Eventually, Marcia suggests the player face the Emperor Commodus himself in a special match. Due to Commodus being the Emperor, the Protagonist is forced to allow Commodus to defeat him, but not before putting up a decent enough fight to fill the mad Emperor's ego. This display amuses Narcissus due to the Protagonist losing in combat, but Marcia is satisfied and she keeps the Protagonist in mind for a further scheme in the days to come.
 
Some 40 days after the Protagonist arrived in Magerius's camp, Marcia will entrust the Protagonist with a scheme to kill the Emperor. The Protagonist has earned Commodus's trust and Commodus desires the Protagonist as a training partner. Marcia brings the Protagonist to Commodus, and eventually Commodus becomes frightened at the ferocity with which the Protagonist is striking him, and he pulls out real swords. However Commodus is no match for the Protagonist, and he is assassinated. Laetus brings Narcissus to the scene as the Protagonist is whisked away.

Later on, Laetus informs the Protagonist that Narcissus was supposedly the one who killed the Emperor, and for his crime, Laetus requests the gladiator who fought on equal ground with Commodus to execute him. Before the match however, Laetus informs the Protagonist that he is expendable as soon as the crowd of Gladiator enthusiasts grow tired of him.
 
Upon day 50, the new Emperor, Septimius Severus will have ascended to the throne, and Laetus informs the Protagonist that there is to be a match held in the new Emperor's honor. Upon arriving at the Colosseum, the Protagonist encounters Marcia, who thanks the Protagonist for his help, and that the whole scheme was set up by Laetus, and that she was merely assisting him in return for being free to go home. Laetus later confirms to the Protagonist that the match and all the plans was set up by him, and that the only loose end to his scheme is to kill the last witness, the Protagonist. However, Laetus makes a bet with the Protagonist, if he can defeat Laetus in combat, Laetus will ensure that the Protagonist has a future under Emperor Severus. Laetus is then defeated in combat, and he yields to the Protagonist's skills, and an entertained Severus requests that the Protagonist receive the best treatment. It is suggested that the Protagonist likely has a fate in the army of the new Emperor.

A.D. 180, The wise and respected Emperor Marcus Aurelius died. His son Commodus took control of the Roman Empire, whose strength had grown over the years. The powerful Empire soon started to falter under his control. In A.D. 192 Commodus declared himself to be the reincarnation of Hercules. He began to neglect his position as Emperor, becoming obsesses with fighting as a gladiator. His people bega doubting him and Rome fell on troubled times. By order of the Emperor, daily tournaments were held at Rome's biggest battlefield the Colosseum. The need for many talented gladiators grew tremendously....
 
The game begins with the Protagonist along with several others being dropped off to an arena owned by the slave trader Largus to serve as his gladiators. The Protagonist spent several days fighting the other gladiators until Magerius purchased the Protagonist. The Protagonist now has to participate in the Atilius arena and the Colosseum in order to pay off Magerius' debt within 50 days.
 
Once the Protagonist reached middle rank (obtained at 15 Palma), Magerius introduces the Protagonist to the mysterious Marcia, who is Emperor Commodus' consort, and her accomplice, the mysterious Laetus. They offer the Protagonsit the opportunity to enter a special bout at the Atilius arena. The next day, as the Protagonist enters the staging area the Protagonist meets Narcissus, one of Marcia's gladiators and the gladiator that the Protagonist will be fighting against in the duel that Marcia arranged. After Narcissus was defeated, Marcia congratulates the Protagonist after the fight. She mentions that she has some work for the Protagonist later on.
 
When I was working on Rescue on the Oregon Trail, I traveled to Independence, Missouri, a jumping-off point for the Oregon Trail, to see where Ranger would have met the Abbott family for the first time. Danger in Ancient Rome sent me overseas to explore the ruins of the Roman Colosseum and Ludus Magnus gladiator school where Marcus and Quintus trained.
 
The third book in the series, Ranger in Time: Long Road to Freedom, is the story of two enslaved children who escape from a tidewater Maryland tobacco plantation and make their way north in search of safety and freedom.
 
Across Lake Champlain, in Northern New York, it was a different story. In early 19th century Clinton County, historians believe that about a third of people were against slavery, about a third were pro-slavery, and a third wanted nothing to do with the whole issue. That meant that abolitionists who did help escapees had to do so more in secret. This barn owned by the Keese Smith family, documented abolitionists, does indeed have a secret room that might have been used as a hiding place.
 
I spent some time in this damp, cobwebby space with my notebook, soaking up the details and imagining what it would have been like on a dark night, with cows walking over the boards on the floor above.
